Making a Knowledge Fight Discord bot

## people

Episode details re:people taken from this GDrive file by Anonymous Wonk Rexford Tugwell, then updated by CelestAI, on Reddit:

* Spreadsheet creator: Anonymous Wonk Rexford Tugwell
* Spreadsheet contributor #2: https://www.reddit.com/user/CelestAI
* GDrive file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxjQXMD-Ptyo_WA48s2ifouW5oQMjpH7PS2FSnpHvXI/edit#gid=375068045

I've added datetime to the OG json file because if the doc is updated in future you can see when the data was last extracted. As I don't expect it to be updated in future I've just extracted it into a json for lookup purposes.

## subjects

*(From 25th Oct 2022)*
Episode details re:subjects are taken from the file 'final.json' from this github repo - https://github.com/RainbowBatch/kfdb - 

The github repo is subject to change and the available data on subjects should be updated in future.
